Linter errors will likely appear due to manifold preprocessor directives or unavailable mod imports. These are a limitation of Cursor (our interface), as it does not support Manifold and frequently fails to download assets, and can be safely ignored. 


Nonetheless, when creating new code, follow the existing preprocessor structure in the project, if present and applicable.
